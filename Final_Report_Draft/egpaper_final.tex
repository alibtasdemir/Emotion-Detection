%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Nowaday, social media usage is quite common.
People can easily write all kinds of emotion in
these media. They want to show their feelings
to other people about a certain subject. In this
case, people can transfer their feelings to other
people through certain words or phrases within
the sentence they have established. Our goal is
to understand the sense of a sentence written by
other people, using certain algorithms is possible
to do on computers.
\end{abstract}

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

Social media provides a lot of data for those who want to do
data analysis. People share their emotions with other peo-
ple through social media, by writing and using videos and
pictures. These feelings can be understood by other people
as well as being understood by today’s computers. Various
methods and algorithms are being developed to enable peo-
ple to detect their emotions. In SemEval, competitions are
held in various workshops and new methods are being de-
veloped. People who rank here share their algorithms with
other people with papers. In addition, data is generated by
data obtained from social media or other media. SemEval,
ISEAR and Fairy Tales.

Our aim is to learn and develop the algorithms that can be
used to detect the emotions of people with the state-of-art
algorithms and methods shared in papers. We will try to
find the right method for this and keep our estimation rates
at the highest level.

Emotion detection in the text, sentences written by people
with specific words, or with specific patterns is to detect
people’s feelings. The frequency and the words used in
the sentence are important. It may be necessary to look at
certain words to detect a emotion. Because people can put
a lot of meaning into some words or words. Here is the
right method to perform the analysis and to make accurate
estimates.

Emotions detection the relationship between people and
other people. They can express their feelings and tell them
how they feel. So he can direct other people to behave
towards them, what they say. If we can make people under-
stand their feelings by computers, we can also make certain
reactions, behaviors or writings to computers in the future.
That’s why it’s a very exciting work that can maximize hu-
man computer interaction. For example, by understanding
the condition of a person who is sick or crying, we can
understand the condition of a baby and the most accurate
intervention can be realized by robots. It will be ensured
that people and robots can communicate more accurately
and perhaps make the human-robot separation difficult and
communicate. It will be a part of something like this, with
natural language processing, and other commonly used al-
gorithms to do this very exciting.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Dual submission}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2018 web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section
will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages
with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
{\bf There will be no extra page charges for CVPR 2018.}

Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.  This includes papers
where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly
altered from those laid down by this style guide.  Note that this
\LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for
supervised revisions of manuscripts.  The reviewing process cannot determine
the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is
reviewed in eleven.  

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
the \verb'\cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)  Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
--- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would
expect that the approximate location will be adequate.

\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.


\subsection{Blind review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind
review.  Blind review does not mean that one must remove
citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to
review a paper unless the previous citations are known and
available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our''
when citing previous work.  That is all.  (But see below for
techreports.)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say
that you are Lucy Smith; it says that you are building on her
work.  If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in
[7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the
paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our
   previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all
   previously known methods.  Why the previous paper was
   accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review
\end{quote}


An example of an acceptable paper:

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of the
   paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to
   all previously known methods.  Why the previous paper
   was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo
   filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''.
   Nature 381(12), 1-213.
\end{quote}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time,
which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that
submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you
had previously published related work.  In such cases, include the
anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as additional material and
cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324,
Supplied as additional material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.

\noindent
FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

\section{Related Work}

We compared our results with two different paper. These are Text-Based Intelligent Learning Emotion System and Multiclass Emotion Extraction From Sentences. Firstly, In paper Text-Based Intelligent Learning Emotion System, ISEAR dataset was used to implement its own methods. As a methodology, they preprocess the stop word. In English, the words are used very often in the English language is eliminated. They then send the appropriate statements to a GUI to determine the emotions in the dataset. The system they use has two parts, server and client, and here they are trying to reach a conclusion by creating a structure called Emotion Dominant tree.

In article Multiclass Emotion Extraction From Sentences, this article also uses the ISEAR dataset. They delete the statements that are meaningless in the dataset from the pretreatment stage and which are not equivalent to any emotion. Punctuation marks all except for exclamation point. The abbreviations with Regex are changed in the long form. Apart from these, stemming, n-gram models are trying to reach the best results by trying. The learning algorithm used is Naive Bayes Classifier.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Color}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the CVPR 2018 web page for a discussion
of the use of color in your document.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Approach}

We used the ISEAR dataset to try our own approach. There are approximately 7500 sentences and 7 different emotion tags in this dataset. Because emotion detection is a classification problem, we have chosen learning algorithms accordingly. The learning algorithms we use are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and CNN / Bidirectional LSTM.

We tried some models in the dataset as a pre-process to make the algorithms ready for use. These are stopwords, stemming, lemmatiztion, TF-IDF, N-gram. With Stopword, words that are not used by themselves but are frequently used are deleted. Stemming is the root of the word. However, some words are irregular and it is impossible to replace them with stemming. Because of this situation, Lemmatization algorithm which is a more advanced algorithm than stemming is used.

Naive Bayes algorithm, cross validation model selection when we make the best results with stemming, bigram, tf-idf and Laplace Smoothing we have received.

Our second algorithm that we tried Isear Dataset is Logistic Regression. We found the highest result for stemming, unigram, tf-idf and L2 Regularization.

Our last machine learning algorithm is SVM. The best results for model selection are provided by stemming, bigram, tf-idf, L2 Regularization, Squared Hinge (L2) Loss Function.
