Nowadays, social media usage is quite common. People can easily write all kinds of emotion in these media. They want to show their feelings to other people about a certain subject. In this case, people can transfer their feelings to other people through certain words or phrases within the sentence they have established. Our goal is to understand the sense of a sentence written by other people, using certain algorithms is possible to do on computers.

This project aim is to develop an algorithm that can be used to detect the emotions of people with the state-of-art algorithms and methods shared in papers. Emotion detection from textual data is, sentences were written by people with speciﬁc words, or with speciﬁc patterns is to detect peoples feelings. The frequency and the words used in the sentence are important. It may be necessary to look at certain words to detect emotion. Because people can put a lot of meaning into some words or words.
